# City Explorer

**Author**: Guy Farley
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
Problem Domain: There is a need for an app that will allow a user to input the name of a city/location, and then receive back GPS coordinates and an interactive map that will alow them to explore that city. The app also needs to provide a clear message to the user if something goes wrong, so they know they need to change their input.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
